In recent years there has been rapid technological development and in two of the areas there are clear benefits\ 
from continuing development efforts, namely in **Serverless** and **quantum computers**.

Serverless computing has been developing very rapidly and has a large impact on the computing industry.\
In the future there won’t be a need to take care of the infrastructure, as it will depend on cloud service providers.\
They are constantly enriching their cloud service systems and providing better development tools.
There are number of benefits that come with serverless:
- developer productivity - now application developers can really focus on the application code itself. Development is quicker since there aren’t any dependencies on DevOps
- cost savings – allows users to only pay for the consumed resources
- flexibility – serverless models scale without need of intervention
- speed – no need to waste time estimating and allocating server space

Over the next decade, serverless computing for sure will make big difference in the way of solving the new challenges we are facing.

The second rapidly growing and gaining strength area of development is the **quantum computing**.
Due to its nature of processing information differently and millions of times faster than classic computers,\
they are expected to be able to solve computation problems considered impossible nowadays.\
Companies like Microsoft, Google, and Intel are racing to build quantum computing tools.
Traditional computers can only process data sequentially and quantum computers can process it simultaneously.
This quality will allow quantum computers for the storage and processing of data as it can check many records simultaneously.\
They also offer more complex calculations than traditional computers and therefore can easily solve problems that would take years to solve on a traditional computer.\
Another applications of quantum computers are medical science, AI technologies, aeronautical engineering and so on.
It’s still not clear how big impact quantum computing will have in the future, but there are some use cases available now.\
One example is where companies can analyze customer behaviour by processing large amounts of data from ads.
